## Faq

#### What is this?

My first app made on my free time after learning some programming.

#### Why was this made?

I wanted to test my skills at java and javafx and make easy to use music player.

#### Why doesn't it work?

Do other .jars work? If not, get Java on your computer. If yes, I don't know.

#### Why are there no tests?

Check first question.

#### Why is the code and the structure so bad?

Check first question.

#### Why is the documentation lacking?

Check first question.

#### Are there any known bugs?

**I think** there is **a small** memory leak that increases memory usage when used for **a long** time.

#### Where are all the settings stored?

In a place that java calls **userRoot** somewhere in your user files. No idea where exactly.

#### Why store them there?

So you can just run .jar and not think about anything else.

#### Why can't I X or Y?

Because I either didn't want to do or didn't think of those things.

#### Why should I use this app?

I don't know. Why not? Why are you even reading this faq?
