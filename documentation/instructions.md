### How it works

1. Press Choose Folder and choose folder where you have .mp3. The app will then scan the chosen folder and all sub folders to make music list.
2. Rest should be obvious.

### The not so obvious things

* L, M and R will change where the sound is coming from.
* Left clicking song on the list will play it and right clicking song will set it to be played next.
* If random is on, you can right click Random button to set random song to be played next.
* If shuffle is on, you can right click Shuffle button to shuffle again.
